# Portfolio Project 
A quick website built on the Astro framework, intended to show off my other projects.
Entirely written from scratch. 

Currently hosted [here](mariusnhaugen.netlify.app)


## Why astro? 
I wanted to play around with the view transitions API and needed a portfolio. Astro was one of the first frameworks to support View Transitions while also being exceptionally suited for statically generated blog content.

Note: MPA View Transitions is only partially supported in Firefox at the time of writing so if you want to see the super fluid headings moving around you might need to give in to the chromium gods for 3 minutes :( sorry.





## ðŸ§ž Astro Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
