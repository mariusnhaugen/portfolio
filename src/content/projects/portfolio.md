#### Why a portfolio website? 

The overengineered portfolio website is a trope that has been done to death, but it remains an approachable project that allows for some unique ways of standing out and show some personal flair. In the age of AI I appreciate the opportunity to show attention to detail both visually and in code.


#### Why Astro?

Astro is primarily a Static Site Generator, and ships only HTML and CSS by default. This makes for an incredibly snappy browsing experience on simple websites. In a world of dense react bundles and three second time-to-interactives it's a nice change of pace. It also has first party support for handling and styling blog content, like this Markdown file, which makes it an appropriate choice for a portfolio.

Astro was also the first framework to support the View Transitions API, the ability to animate elements across a Multi-Page Application. I still find it incredibly impressive every time I come back to the site.
