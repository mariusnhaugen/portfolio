#### Why rust? 

I specifically wanted to learn Rust because of its position as a low level language. Having recently done primarily web work, it forced me to confront memory concepts I hadn't seen since university. Adding a modern low level language to the toolbox for the future also just seemed useful, to be honest.

(most important for any sideproject, I was having fun)

#### Why a game? 
I had never made one. Designing a game has wildly different constraints from the webapps I'm already used to, and I was initially sketching out UI elements and game progression ideas like a child enchanted with the possiblities of a crayon.

The Bevy engine specifically forces you to buy into the idea of building software using the ECS pattern, which provided another brain teaser to wrap my head around.
